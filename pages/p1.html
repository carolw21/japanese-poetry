          This poem alludes to an occasion on which the Emperor was helping farmers by scaring away birds as they harvested the crop. In a sudden rain shower, he sought shelter in a make-shift hut, thatched only with coarse rushes which afforded little protection. The slow, quiet dripping of the dew from the roof contrasts with the sweat of the farmers harvesting the rice. Mindful of their difficult labor, the Emperor sympathizes with the peasants.

At that time, smooth transition in the seasons was attributed to the wise rule of the Emperor. So, the depiction of summer arriving after spring has passed conveys a sense of hopefulness and satisfaction with the reign.

          The white robes, a symbol of freshness and invigorating spirit, are the vestments of the shrine that priestesses used during summer Shinto rituals. Moreover, the sincerity of one’s behavior is said to be revealed by wetting clothes with holy water then drying them. The hill lies southeast of Nara and could be seen from Emperor Jito’s palace. This poem alludes (<i>honka-dori</i>) to one in <i>Manyoshu</i>, varying only with きにけらし for きたるらし and ほすて ふ for ほしたり.
          <br>
          The poets of #1 and #2 (Emperors Tenji and Jitō) and of #99 and #100 (Emperors Gotoba and Juntoku) bear a parent-child relationship. #1 conveys Tenji’s sympathy with the hardships of the peasants, and #2 depicts Jito’s wise reign, while #99 and #100 have darker tones and meanings, giving an interesting contrast between the beginning and end of <i>Hyakunin Isshu</i>.

          This poem depicts a lonely night separated from one’s lover. The male copper pheasant, known for its long tail, was believed to part from its mate at night. The term “山鳥” calls to mind the plight of sleeping by oneself. The <i>jo-kotoba</i> describes a copper pheasant’s droopy, long tail and repeats the particle の four times to help the reader visualize the deep, lonely night. The lengthy <i>jo-kotoba</i> also symbolizes this loneliness. Line 4: ‘long night’ or ‘drifting life’ and the next phrase convey the writer’s emotion by asking, “must I sleep alone through this long, drawn out night?” It is here that the poet expresses sorrow at spending the night alone. This phrase alone would have been enough for the purpose of a love poem, but the visual image of the copper pheasant’s long, droopy tail elicits the reader’s emotion and sympathy even more strongly.

          This poem portrays a scenic outlook and depicts the wonderful moment when obstructions evaporate and one’s view suddenly opens up to the ocean and Mount Fuji. Its expanse contrasts the blue sky and ocean with Fuji’s perfectly white lofty peak.
          <br><br>
          Yamabe’s original in <i>Manyoshu</i> Volume 3:318 is a <i>han-ka</i> (田子の浦ゆうち出 でてみれば真白にぞ不尽の高嶺に雪は降りける). Both the <i>chō-ka</i> (long poem) and the <i>han-ka</i> suggest that the white snow on Mount Fuji is not just a beautiful scene, but also a symbol of divine sublimity (<i>kami</i>). In the past, Mount Fuji was worshiped as a nature god before whom humans were compelled to bow down in reverence.

          This poem portrays a beautiful scene, in which a lonely stag, as he treads through the colorful, fallen autumn leaves, calls for his mate. As the poet, also presumably walking through the autumn leaves, hears the cry, he is overwhelmed with sadness. In Chinese poetry, “秋悲 (autumnal melancholy)” derives sadness from seeing withering plants in the autumn. Japanese poets also depict autumn as a melancholy time of the year, while farmers see autumn as the busy harvest season preceding the idleness of the long winter. Beyond the loneliness, there is also a sublime serenity, the peace of mind that many find in aloneness. For aristocrats unable to enter the priesthood or to live in the secluded mountains, <i>waka</i> served as a means to experience life as an ascetic.

          Stars in the winter transforming into hoar frost – what a magical moment! This poet uses just 31 syllables to describe a magnificent winter wonderland in the sky, while he laments that the night has almost passed. In Chinese legend, the Weaver (Vega) is only permitted to meet her husband the Herdboy (Altair) on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month on a bridge formed by flights of magpies that take pity on them. Magpie Bridge is a metaphor (<i>mitate</i>) for the stairway to the Imperial Palace in Kyoto. The Imperial Court is also often compared to the celestial world. Guarding the Palace late at night and seeing the frost-covered stairway, the poet thinks to himself that the night is passing, and maybe it is just like that on the bridge in the sky.

          The poem was written at a farewell banquet for Nakamaro in Mingzhou (present-day Ningbo, China) before he set off for Japan. Seeing the majestic moon rising in the sky, the poet was reminded of the same moon that rose over Mount Mikasa where he had prayed for a safe journey before he left Japan. After three decades, it was finally time to return to his mother country. Feeling nostalgic, Nakamaro composed this poem. The great Chinese poet Li Bai’s famous verse, “<span lang="ja-jp"> 頭を挙げて山月を望み&nbsp; 頭を低れて故郷を思う” </span> (“Raising my head, I gaze at the bright moon; lowering my head, I think of home.”) also captures this nostalgia.

          Legend has it that Kisen Bonze was in actuality a mountain wizard who made an elixir of immortality. Such stories add an aura of mystery to this poem as the reader tries to understand Kisen’s life in the mountains. Although people thought that Kisen lived a secluded life on the Mount of Sorrow because he couldn’t bear the hardship and sorrow of the outside world, Kisen was not only content with his tranquil and peaceful life, but also grateful for the worldly concern people had for him. This poem does not convey the loneliness of a recluse, but rather the contentment of a free and unrestrained life. Its ending sets a light and cheerful mood, with an image of Bonze Kisen unconcerned with worldly matters.

          This poem captures a beautiful woman’s lament over her withered beauty. The <i>kake-kotobas</i> intertwine tangible scenes with intangible feelings. The poet could be gazing long (ながめ) at the wilted flowers (花の色), while the spring long rain (ながめ) continues to fall (ふる) into the world (世), or the same set of words could refer to her lost beauty and sensuality (色) and her aged (ふる, 世) self, while she has been lost in her idle thoughts (ながめ, い たづらに), as if time has played a prank (いたづらに) on her. The similarity between raindrops/teardrops and the feeling of entrapment induced by the long rain relates rain to the sorrows of aging.

          This poem depicts the vicissitudes of life as departure, encounter, and reunion are constantly happening at Osaka Gate. Three sets of phrases, 行く and 帰る, 知る and 知らぬ, 別れ and 逢ふ, form antitheses that describe the Osaka checkpoint. This poem reflects the Buddhist concept of 無常 (むじょう- ‘inconstancy’), the transient nature and evanescence of life and the idea that we meet only to part. It is as if one were looking down at a busy intersection in a city from a nearby building’s rooftop and saw the hustle and bustle of the world as people constantly pass each other by. Yet there is also a sense of serenity as one looks down at such scene as if it were a miniature of life of which the narrator is not part.

          This poem was composed as the poet was setting sail for the Oki Islands during his banishment. Shortly before departure for China as an assistant envoy, the author discovered that the chief envoy Fujiwara-no-Tsunetsugu had replaced his own damaged ship with that of the author, whereupon the author wrote a satirical poem called “Saidō no Uta,” which irritated Emperor Saga, who exiled him to Oki Province. Before departing, Takamura requests a nearby fishing boat to announce his departure. This poem gives the impression not only of subtle desperation, but also of quiet dignity. Without knowing the background of this poem, one might think that the poem depicts a courageous sailor ready to set off on a great adventure.

          Written before Henjō became a priest, this poem compares the five dancing maidens to celestial maidens. 雲の通ひ路 is the path by which the young maidens exit the room or stage, here compared to the path by which celestial maidens ascend to heaven. He is afraid they will fly back to Heaven and so requests the clouds to block their way, a fantasy that was probably shared by other witnesses to the dance as well.
          <br><br>
          The metaphor of the dancers as celestial maidens is said to have originated when Emperor Tenmu composed the following poem, supposedly as he was playing on a zither and the celestial maidens descended while dancing: <span lang="ja-jp">&nbsp;乙女ども&nbsp; 乙女さびすも&nbsp; 唐玉を袂にまきて&nbsp; 乙女さびすも.</span>

          Written for the third daughter of Emperor Kōkō, Imperial Princess Suishi, this poem expresses how Yōzei’s love towards Suishi has grown gradually into a deep passion, just as drops of water from the mountaintop collect to form streams, and eventually grow into rivers. The poem plays with the double meanings of sounds and words to combine the objective depiction of a natural scene with subjective personal emotions. Since Yōzei married Suishi afterwards, one might think that this love poem had a happy ending. However, for those familiar with Yōzei’s life, this poem, especially the mention of a “deep pool,” also conveys a sense of dark and deep-seated resentment. For physically assaulting his courtiers and violating taboos, Emperor Yōzei was deposed and lived 60 years as a reclusive Retired Emperor.

          As written in the foreword of this poem in <i>Kokin Wakashū</i>, this poem was composed when Emperor Kōkō, still an imperial prince at the time, gave the green herbs to someone unknown. The receiver could be a lover, a courtier, or an ailing relative. Like Emperor Tenji whose sleeves become wet from the dew in a harvest hut in #1, the Imperial Prince went out to the fields in the snow as to pick herbs in the image of a sympathetic and ideal leader.
          <br>
          This poem portrays a beautiful scene by including the mellow images of the ‘spring fields,’ ‘young herbs,’ ‘sleeves,’ and ‘snow,’ and by contrasting the white of the snow with the green of the herbs. Such depictions of the colorful scenery and young herbs imbue liveliness – just what one needs when one has fallen ill. This also reflects the genuine and caring heart of the Emperor, as this will prove helpful in his future reign.

          Yukihira was departing Kyoto for his position as Governor in Inaba. The poem expresses his strong will to return, thus merging the dynamic aspects of life with the sadness of leaving.
          <br><br>
          The location and time implied in this poem include both the present (departing from Kyoto for Inaba) and the future (in Inaba longing to return to Kyoto). The poet has concisely expressed not only his unease at the upcoming departure, but also a hopeful anticipation of a future return. On a side note, this poem is often cited when one wishes for a parted friend or a lost pet to return.

          This poem was composed from the perspective of a woman at a Poetry Contest held by Empress Hanshi in the Kampyō era (889-898 CE). In the Heian period, if one dreamt of a beloved person frequently, it was thought to mean that one’s love was requited. Women often worried about being deserted and betrayed by a lover or husband. Thus, it is not hard to imagine a situation wherein a woman involved in a secret love pondered what the absence of the man from her dreams suggested about his love interest in real life. This poem conveys the melancholy and frustration of the narrator as she wonders, “Why are you hiding from people, even in my dreams, when there is no chance of being seen by others?” This description leads the reader to associate the constantly changing waves with the emotional changes of a love-stricken heart and to attribute a dreamlike characteristic to the lovers. The Fujiwara family came to dominate the government as Emperors married almost exclusively from this family.

          This poem captures Lady Ise’s exasperation towards a detached lover, as she asks in her poem, “Is not seeing each other, even though life is as short as the reeds and their nodes, what you were saying?” One might wonder who the man was that had so heartlessly dismissed Lady Ise, as Lady Ise was so charming and loved by sons of regents and men from the Imperial family alike. Nevertheless, the image of short reeds in the dreary tideland characterizes the passion and bitter resentment of Lady Ise, as do the skillful and creative usage of the <i>jo-kotoba</i>, <i>kake-kotoba</i>, and <i>en-go</i> in the poem.

          Fujiwara-no-Hōshi was originally a court lady to Emperor Daigo, but her famed beauty later earned ex-emperor Uda’s favor and he took her. Prince Motoyoshi’s love affair with her, now revealed, could be seen as a treacherous act challenging the authority of the Emperor. Despite the danger, Prince Motoyoshi expresses his passion toward Hōshi, even though it might “exhaust” him; i.e., cause his death in this situation. His reference to a channel depth marker might also refer to the depth of his tears, or of his troubles.

          This poem is written from the perspective of a woman who has been waiting for a man all night. At the time when this poem was composed, men and women in relationships had distinct roles; namely, the woman waited patiently at her residence for the man to come. Here, rather than the man, the moon rises to greet her. ばかり has a similar effect: it was only because the man had made a promise that she waited for so long. However, this poem is not merely one of disappointment and sorrow. There is a nonchalance to the poem, as if the man’s absence enhances the poignancy of the moon in the sky, which she would not otherwise have noticed.

          Influenced by Chinese poets employing acrostic wordplay during the late Six Dynasties period, Japanese poets also started incorporating this into their poems. In the above poem, Yasuhide has depicted the wind (風) coming from the mountain (山) as so wild that it is like a devastating storm (嵐), so 山+ 風=嵐. Other examples include the following poem in <i>Kokin Wakashū</i> by Ki-no-Tomonori: 雪降れば木毎に花ぞ咲きにけるいづれを梅とわきて折らまし ‘Since the snow is falling, flowers are blooming on every tree, so I should distinguish which ones are the plum trees before breaking the tree branches’: 木+毎=梅. Other combinations such as 十+八+公=松 and 八+木=米 are used in 離合詩 (acrostics).

          This poem is based on a verse in the poem ‘<i>Yanzi-lou</i>’ (‘<i>Pavilion of Swallows</i>’) composed by the famous Chinese poet Bai Juyi: <span lang="ja-jp">燕子楼の中霜月の夜&nbsp; 秋来たりてただ一人のために長し</span> ‘A frosty moonlit night in the Pavilion of Swallows, the autumn is dragging on for me alone,’ which describes the patient devotion of Director Zhang’s lover, even after he has passed away. Therefore, instead of the poet’s own emotions, #23 is more about the woman’s feelings as depicted in Bai Juyi’s poem. However, ‘<i>Pavilion of Swallows</i>’ only focuses on the sadness of one person, while Chisato’s poem has a certain universality that could apply to anyone. The association of the moon or autumn with sad emotions was widely accepted in Heian literature. The author even works in some Chinese-style parallelism with "moon"-"body" and "thousands"- "one".

          Michizane, recently made Minister of the Right, composed this poem when accompanying Retired Emperor Uda to a temple on Mount Tamuke prior to a hunting expedition. As to why the offering had been left behind, one explanation is that by etiquette, Michizane would not have been allowed to present his offering at the same time as the Emperor. Alternatively, perhaps the offering was left behind due to their haste. By presenting the crimson autumn leaves as tribute, the poet portrays a magnificent scene in which the myriad autumn leaves on the mountain—not just the normally pre-made strips of <i>nusa</i>—are offered to the gracious and mighty god. This image glorifies the deity’s power to control the nature and grant the Retired Emperor and his entourage safe travel.

          The double meanings of the many <i>kake-kotoba</i> might make the poem seem puzzling at first, but the double meanings all connect under one theme: romantic attraction to a woman. It is said that this poem was a gift from Sadakata to a woman, given with an actual climbing vine, <i>sanekazura</i>.
          <br>
          Like #22, in which the “storm” owes its name to its devastating power, this poem also demonstrates how names of places and objects were often used in Heian poems to trigger association with ideas and themes, some of which function as <i>uta-makura</i>. The image of the entwined winding vines of the “sleeping together” <i>sanekazura</i> gives the reader mental associations of a romantic encounter and tenacious love.

           Retired Emperor Uda was so impressed by the autumn scenery on Mount Ogura that he recommended that his son, Emperor Daigo, visit the mountain. Tadahira agreed to compose this poem as an invitation to Daigo. Like #24, this outing most likely occurred after a hunt, was composed by an attendant of a Retired Emperor, and red maple leaves are mentioned. Furthermore, Tadahira was likely to have been implicated in his older brother Tokihira’s quarrel with Sugawara-no-Michizane (#24). After Michizane’s demotion, Tokihira died, allegedly due to Michizane’s revengeful ghost. Tokihira’s death led to Tadahira’s becoming leader of the Fujiwara clan. Therefore, this poem not only reflects the harmonious interrelations between an Emperor, a Retired Emperor, and a courtier and their appreciation towards the nature, but might also suggest that Teika (redactor of HNIS) was aware of the power struggle involved.

          Putting the phrases in their correct orders and the <i>kake-kotoba</i> together, this poem can be translated as “Like the “<i>izumi</i>” River, which flows as it gushes forward and divides the plain of Mika, when (<i>itsu-mi</i>) did we ever see each other that I am so love-struck?” The verses skillfully combine the flowing streams of Mika Plain with a yearning emotion, unfolding innocent first love.

          As winter arrives, the mountain village becomes even lonelier as there are neither visiting guests nor grass. The absence of people and the withered plants also symbolize the natural tendency towards deterioration and death of people and nature, like the final days before death. The model for this poem was written by Fujiwara-no-Okikaze: <span lang="ja-jp">秋くれば虫とともにぞなかれぬる人も草葉もかれぬと思へば</span>. However, unlike Okikaze’s poem, which describes a lonely autumn, #28 chooses winter instead to heighten the sense of forlornness created by the absence of people and the withering vegetation. Occult aesthetics and spiritual occurrences in <i>waka</i> poems were best delivered through winter as a medium to a quiescent and monochrome world.

          Chrysanthemums were originally imported from China as medicinal plants and were first written about in <i>Kokin Wakashū</i>. They have become the national emblem of Japan and were adopted as the imperial crest (hence the Japanese imperial dynasty is termed “Chrysanthemum Throne.”) In this poem the hoar frost is described as hardly distinguishable from the white petals of the chrysanthemum. This comparison, <i>mi-tate</i> (見立て), captures the elegant figures of white chrysanthemums through the clear, shiny, and refreshing characteristics of the first cold hoar frost. With the inversion of word order in this poem, “flowers of the white chrysanthemum” is put at the very end of the poem to emphasize its exquisite subject.

          When Emperor Go-Toba asked Fujiwara-no-Teika and Ietaka for a distinguished poem from <i>Kokin Wakashū</i>, both recommended this poem. The common interpretation is a saddened man returning home at dawn after parting from his indifferent lover, with an association between the coldness of the lady and the coldness of the waning moon. Dawn refers to the general time a man returns from his lover’s residence. The waning moon is often visible in the eastern sky at daybreak, appearing larger and bleaker since it is low on the horizon. However, Teika commented that “it is only the waning moon that appears to be cold, not the lady.” Therefore, Teika sees the cold moon as a contrast to the passionate night the man has spent at the lady’s residence instead of a comparison. Whether it is a contrast or a similarity between nature and the human world, this famous poem provides a vivid night scene and leaves the reader room to interpret the situation.

          Upon first seeing a moonlit yard during the winter, one might mistake it for a snow-covered scene, as in Chinese poet Li Bai’s famous verse, “<span lang="ja-jp">牀前月光を看る&nbsp; 疑うらくは是地上の霜かと</span> (The bright moonlight before my bed, could it be hoar frost on the floor?)” This poem was composed in the winter of 908 when Korenori was proceeding to his new appointment in Yamato Province. It is said that he composed this poem after waking up in a lodging near the mountains in Yoshino at dawn and was impressed by the snowy scene outside. Yoshino is a place where many Emperors built imperial villas, so to residents in the capital Yoshino is a detached village. Therefore, rather than with loneliness, a snow-covered Yoshino village is more strongly associated with time immemorial and peaceful quiet. In addition, in the poem Yoshino is adorned by a blanket of moonlight as if the sleeping village would remain forever in such tranquility.

          It was noted in <i>Kokin Wakashū</i> that this poem was composed at the Yamanaka checkpoint on Mount Shiga, on the mountain route starting from Kyoto and coming out at the village of Shiga (present-day Ōtsu City, Shiga Prefecture). This was the route taken by people paying homage at the Sūfuku Temple in Shiga. As a place with beautiful cherry blossoms falling like snowflakes every spring, Shiga is also famous as an <i>uta-makura</i>. The poet also implies the resistance of nature to the will of man. Inspired by this poem, the main compiler of <i>Kokin Wakashu</i>, Ki-no-Tsurayuki, composed the following poem: <span lang="ja-jp">年ごとにもみじ葉流す竜田川みなとや秋の泊まりなるらむ</span> (<i>Kokin Wakashū</i> Autumn 2-311). ‘Every year maple leaves flow along the Tatsuta River, the estuary where the maple leaves blanket the stream is a harbor for autumn.’

          The headnote of this poem in the <i>Kokinshū</i> says it is composed “on the falling of the cherry blossoms.” The restlessness of the cherry blossoms contrasts with the peacefulness of a sunny day in spring. This could also be a contrast between eternity and an instant, or might also imply that even eternity (imperial power) is constantly changing. Even though falling petals suggest decay and sadness, the falling blossoms are described as a somewhat incongruent but beautiful scene on a peaceful day in spring. Also, the repetition of “ha” column syllables (久方, 光, 春の日,花) and the four の’s create unique pauses in the rhythm that the reader can visualize as a sharp transition from the peaceful scene of a sunny day in spring to the scattering cherry blossoms. Perhaps it is not the cherry blossoms that lack placid hearts, but the people watching the falling cherry blossoms, or are the people watching the scattering cherry blossoms concerned for the continued tranquility of the imperial reign?

          In Zeami’s Noh play <i>Takasago</i>, an old couple appears from the mist on Takasago Bay in front of a Shinto priest. They are talking happily and sweeping up the needles under the renowned Takasago Pines which, along with the famed Suminoe Pine of distant Sumiyoshi, are called <i>aioi-no-matsu</i>, or “Paired Pines.” The old couple is the incarnation of the Paired Pines. They use a broom to sweep away trouble and a rake to gather good fortune. The couple and the pines in the legend of Takasago have come to symbolize the happiness of family life and longevity. The basic sense of this poem is that as the narrator’s friends have all passed away, even the pines cannot provide companionship for the narrator despite their longevity. This is a poem that ironically laments longevity as close friends pass away.

          This poem is preceded by a headnote in the <i>Kokin Wakashū</i>: “There was a house where the poet stayed each time he made a pilgrimage to Hatsuse (Nara Prefecture), but had not been able to visit for some years. When the poet finally visited again, the house owner said ‘As you can see, your lodging is where it always was in the past,’ whereupon the poet broke off a branch from the plum tree planted there and composed this poem.” The house owner’s remark can be interpreted as a slightly annoyed comment about the poet’s lack of visit, though his lodging has always been there. In this context, the poet seems to mean: “I cannot fathom people’s hearts and I do not know whether you feel the same way towards me as in the past, but in this familiar village the plum blossom is as fragrant as ever.” As the flow of time gradually obscures one’s feelings, the reunion of two old friends or lovers, mixed with the spring sentiment and fragrant plum blossom scent, awakens the past and lingers in the simplicity of the nature.

          This poem of a mere five lines consists of a number of cultural assumptions and insights into nature. The short duration of a summer night is the basis of the poet’s conjecture and the personification of the moon as someone “dwelling (やどる) among the clouds.” Another belief is that the moon “resides” in the western mountains, since it is always seen setting behind the mountains and hills in the west. We could interpret this poem as follows: “This summer night is so brief that the day has dawned already while it still seems like evening, leaving too little time for the moon to make it back to its western mountain home. Where in the clouds might the moon be dwelling then?” The poet has cleverly incorporated personification and his personal emotion to create a delightful image of the moon hurrying back home but needing to lodge behind the clouds momentarily as the sun rises, as well as the poet himself looking for the moon as if he wants to admire it once more before it can hide again.

          Strong winds are commonplace on autumn grasslands in Japan. As the wind blows incessantly, the shining dew or rain drops fall and scatter like unstrung pearls. Moreover, onomatopoeia of “し” in “白露に風の吹きしく” and of た sounds in “つらぬきとめぬ たまぞちりける” mimics the sound of the rain and wind, further bestowing upon the reader the sensation of the refreshing autumn air. Shining dew is also compared to pearls in the <i>Kokin Wakashū</i> and the famous <i>Tale of Genji</i>. Here are two examples: 浅緑糸よりか けて白露を玉にもぬける春の柳 (Henjō <i>Kokin Wakashū</i> Spring Volume 1-27) ‘twisting the light green thread that strung the shining dew drops together like pearls, this spring willow tree.’ Another of Funya-no-Asayasu’s poems, 秋の野に置く白露は玉なれやつらぬきかくる蜘蛛の糸筋 (<i>Kokin Wakashū</i> Autumn Volume 1-225), ‘Are the dew drops dotting the autumn fields not pearls? Weaving together those pearls on the leaves is the spider silk.’

          This poem is followed by this introduction in section 84 of <i>Tales of Yamato</i>: “This same lady (Ukon), after a certain gentleman had sworn in every possible way to the gods that he would never forget her, but still did, composed this poem and sent it to him.” Knowing this context, one could naturally see the poem as highly sarcastic towards the hypocrisy of the lover. The second half of the poem hints that Ukon’s neglectful lover will die now that he has abandoned her. The words appear threatening, yet they are composed in such a mild and subtle way that they fully demonstrate the narrator’s sorrow and sadness. It is speculated from evidence in <i>Tales of Yamato</i> that Ukon sent this poem to Fujiwara-no-Atsutada (#43). Coincidentally, Atsutada died at the early age of 38.

No I shall not, as there is no one to deliver it.” In contrast, lines 3-5 of #39 can be paraphrased as “I have concealed it, yet it overwhelms me – why do I love her so?” The <i>jo-kotoba</i> not only serves as a part of the wordplay, but also describes a desolate yet touching scene that contrasts with the narrator’s overwhelming affection and hints at the fruitless hidden love. The tall bamboos in a field of sparse blady grass reflect the narrator’s excessive affection. These expressions depict the confusion and towering passion one experiences in a secret love.

          This poem and #41 are presented together in the beginning of <i>Shūishū</i>, an imperial anthology of Japanese <i>waka</i>, with the headnote “From a poetry contest of the Tenryaku Era,” referring to the Palace Poetry Contest in 960. #40 and #41 were the two finalists on the theme “secret love,” but the judge, Fujiwara-no-Saneyori, unable to decide on a winner, appealed to Emperor Murakami, who hummed this poem and decided the contest. Although in the modern sense, the narrator’s concern with people noticing his hidden emotions may appear to be innocent and exaggerated, this poem was composed during a time when societal reputation was highly regarded. There were even situations in which one would prefer death to revelation of a secret love (#89). Despite the fact that one was allowed to have his or her own choice in love relationships, this poem accurately depicts the passion as well as frustration of a secret love with someone of whom society might not approve. The Taira sprang from Emperor Kanmu (781-806) and fought the Minamoto for dominance in 1185.

          思ひ (“to think”) can refer to both 知れず (“No one knows”) and to そめ (“I just began to think about her”). The most common interpretation is: “The rumor of me being in love has already spread far and wide, even though I have only just begun to love her secretly so that she is unknown to others.” This was the poem that lost to #40 in the Palace Poetry Contest in 960, but it still gained great praise. In the <i>Shasekishū</i>, a collection of parables written during the Kamakura period, the poet Tadami was depicted as dying of depression and anorexia after losing the contest. Although the story is fictional and Tadami continued writing poetry, results of a poetry contest, such as the one mentioned here, were of great importance to poets at that time. #40 might have won the contest because of Emperor Murakami’s personal preference, but this poem has a more appealing tone of calm. One often has delicate and perplexed emotions at the beginning of an affair. This poem honestly depicts the consternation of being discovered.

          This alludes to an anonymous poem: 君をおきてあだし心をわ が持たば末の松山波も越えなむ (<i>Kokin Wakashū</i> The Azuma Poems 1093).
‘If I ever have the heart to abandon you, may waves engulf Mount Suenomatsu.’ The headnote preceding this poem in <i>Goshūi Wakashū</i> says, “For the person whose lover has changed her mind.” な is like ね in modern Japanese as an invitation for the listener to respond and possesses an incredibly pitiful and despairing voice as if the narrator were begging and weeping. It is interesting to note that though both #42 and #38 describe one’s desolation after being abandoned, #42 is not nearly as caustic and bitter as #38, suggesting that the narrator is feeling more regretful about his lingering affection, than angry and spiteful towards the past lover’s changed feelings.

          This poem was preceded by the headnote “Sent the next morning, after he had started visiting the woman.” It seems to be a poem by a man who feels that his previous love affairs pale in comparison with his current love, though some interpret this poem as one in which a man expresses doubts about their love, or some factor preventing the two lovers from meeting again. Another possibility is that the romantic liaison might have been opposed by either party’s family, so the agonizing frustration the narrator experiences now is much more intense and complicated than before the liaison.

          The classification of this poem at the time of the poetry contest was “early love before a first meeting.” Later it was reclassified under “lovers that cannot meet again.” The highlight of this poem is the usage of a counter- factual supposition in depicting the narrator’s profound frustration and sadness in a way that is straightforward and easily understood. Under Teika’s interpretation, this poem can be paraphrased as “If we had never met at all, I would not be so resentful towards her indifference and my sorrowful fate.” The reason why the lovers cannot meet again is unclear. However, from the narrator’s resentment towards the woman, it is likely that the narrator is troubled by coldness and neglect from the one he loves. Whether it be that the woman has found a new love, or that she is purposely playing hard to get, this poem skillfully portrays the narrator’s delicate emotional state when his love is not fulfilled. It might be due to its focus on a regretful love, as in #43, that these two poems were placed next to each other.

          According to the headnote in <i>Shuishū</i>, this poem was composed for a woman who, despite having formed a social intercourse with the narrator, has not replied to the narrator’s amorous entreaties and has not seen him again. Therefore, this poem portrays the desperation and loneliness of a man who has so suffered from his love that he would rather die, yet doing so would probably not even be noticed by the woman. Additionally, the first three lines could also be interpreted as meaning that no one else would sympathize with or understand the narrator after knowing that his romantic pursuit has been unbearably futile. Born into a family of powerful politicians, Fujiwara-no-Koremasa possessed not only proficient scholastic ability, but also good looks. Therefore, it is not surprising that few people would believe that Koremasa encountered a failed love affair.

          The 4th line not only expresses the emotion of the boatman who has lost his direction, but also conveys the concerns and worries of a man who is lost in love – they both share unease towards their hindered, wayward paths. The description of a boatman without a paddle in the estuary brings the intangible emotions surrounding love forcefully to the reader. The only point of contention in this poem is the 3rd line. Most commentators believe that かぢ refers to oar- like wooden tools and を is an object marker, so かぢを絶え means “having lost the oar.” Other commentators, possibly including Fujiwara-no-Teika, interpret かぢを as the noun which means “oar cord,” and under this interpretation かぢを絶え means “the oar cord is severed,” which yields the same result.

          The source of this poem, <i>Shūi Wakashū</i>, contains a foreword to this poem that says “At <i>Kawara-in</i>, people discuss the arrival of autumn at the desolate residence.” <i>Kawara-in</i> had been the birthplace of many works by great poets such as Ariwara-no-Narihira (#17). But after the death of Tōru, rumors about his haunting spirit and the flooding of the Kamogawa River led to <i>Kawara-in</i> being deserted. However, during Egyo Hoshi’s time, poets of refined tastes who cherished the residence gathered there once again to continue the production of poems. This group of poets consisted mostly of middle- or lower- class men, but who all shared profound appreciation and affection towards <i>Kawara-in</i>, though now dilapidated and derelict.

          The waves shatter into water drops against the rock, yet the rock remains motionless, as if nothing has occurred. This scene also serves as a metaphor for the narrator’s romantic feelings crashing uselessly into pieces on the immovable and indifferent woman being pursued. So the first two lines (<i>jo-kotoba</i>) not only describe the waves beating on the rock, but also imply her neglect of the narrator. There is also assonance of the sound <i>“mi,”</i> in いたみ, な み, and のみ. It was trendy in poetry at the time to use the phrase “くだけて物 を思ふ (being shattered, a time to think)” to describe the intensity of one’s troubling thoughts. For example, Sone-no-Yoshitada (#46) composed the following poem: 山賤のはてに刈り干す麦の穂のくだけて物を思ふころか な (<i>Sotanshū</i> 135). It means “Just as the farmer cuts down the last wheat stem and mills it into powder, it shatters me, my thoughts.” Waves shattered by the unmovable rock here and the wheat stem smashed into powder in Yoshitada’s poem are both vivid metaphors of the narrator’s desperation and hurt feelings.

          ‘Like the watch fire (hi) set by guards of the imperial court, which burns all night and is extinguished during the day, my thoughts of love (<i>omohi</i>) burn up my heart at night and leave me alone through the day.’ The <i>jo-kotoba</i> here (the guards’ watch fire) describes a natural scene, while the last line conveys the narrator’s emotions. The 3rd and 4th lines serve as a link both to the description of the guard’s fire and to the narrator’s emotions. Night is when lovers meet, so, just like the watch fire, love blazes at night and dies out in the morning. In Kyoto, before streetlights, the solitary burning fire lighting up its dark surroundings created a unique poetic atmosphere and has come to symbolize the burning passion of lovers.

          Putting all segments of this poem in their logical order, it translates into: “I did not chersih even my life in the past, but now, for the sake of seeing you, I hope it may last longer.” Like #49, this poem expresses the narrator’s passionate love. The headnote preceding this poem in the <i>Goshūi Washū</i> reads, “composed after returning from the lady’s quarters.” Therefore, this poem is interpreted as a “morning-after” poem, composed by a man as he returns home from his first overnight stay at a woman’s residence after an extensive pursuit. In other words, in the past, the narrator was willing to risk his life for love. Yet after a night with this lady, he craves a longer life. This poem depicts the drastic change in the narrator’s attitude towards life, as he begins to enjoy life and love.        </p>

          The poet employs many poetic literary devices to skillfully convey his love in this poem. The <i>kake-kotobas</i> in the poem could be interpreted as follows: “How should I describe to you (いぶき) that I love you so, and how unaware you are. Like Mount Ibuki (いぶき)’s moxa grass, my thoughts are burning.” The headnote of this poem in its source, <i>Goshūi Wakashū</i>, says, “Composed right after (the poet) started seeing her,” so it is likely that the poet sent this poem as a part of the first letter to the woman he was passionately in love with. Even though they are rarely heard of today, Japanese mugworts were commonly used by people, including ladies, of the Heian period during moxibustion treatments.

          The headnote to this poem in the <i>Goshūi Wakashū</i> reads “sent to a woman after returning from her chambers on a snowy day.” Therefore, this poem is interpreted as a “morning-after” poem, composed by a man as he returns home from an overnight stay at a woman’s residence. At first glance, this poem might appear to be describing a saddening experience, but a closer examination reveals the narrator’s strong wish to stay with the lady and his reproachful feeling towards the start of a day, even though he understands that a night never occurs without daybreak. Reason, which the narrator understands, conflicts with his honest emotion towards separating from his lover during the day. Such contradiction was praised as a refined style of poems, as it portrays the ideal image of a man in love, who unconditionally sacrifices himself in the name of love, even though he knows that certain things he wishes for are unreasonable.

          In <i>Kagerō Nikki</i>, Udaishō writes that in August 955, she gave a difficult delivery to her son, but soon discovered that her husband Kanaie was having extramarital affairs. When he eventually visited her, she made him wait outside the gate. The next morning she gave him this poem, along with a chrysanthemum that had changed color (as a symbol of his changed heart). In return, Kanaie composed the following poem: げにやげに冬の夜ならぬ真木 の戸も遅くあくるはわびしかりけり ‘As you said, the winter night is not only long, but when the yew plum pine gate opens late, it is also harsh.’ Udaishō contemplated taking Buddhist vows, but ultimately devoted herself to her children instead.

          In the system of ‘duolocal marriage (通い婚),’ if a husband lost passion towards his wife, he could simply stop visiting her, and eventually terminate the marriage. There was nothing women at that time could do but wait. When the newlywed Takashina-no-Kishi composed this poem, Michitaka must have sworn never to change his feelings towards her. Even though Kishi might have been happy during the early days of marriage to Michitaka, she may also have felt uncertain regarding the future, compelling her to wish that she could
          die on the day when Michitaka swore the oath. In actuality, Michitaka was known to be a caring husband to Kishi, and Kishi was praised as a wise mother and educated woman. Unfortunately, Michitaka passed away suddenly, Kishi’s sons fell from power, and her daughter became a priestess, all of which gives a sad twist to this poem.

          On September 12th 999, the Minister of the Left strolled around the Daikaku Temple’s Waterfall (Taki) Palace along with others including Fujiwara-no-Kintō. Afterwards, Kintō composed this poem. Although the waterfall had dried up long before and the sounds could no longer be heard, its fame still endured. は forms a contrast with こそ, while the repetition of た and な create a formidable resonance.

          It is believed that this poem was sent to an unknown lover by Lady Izumi Shikibu when she was very ill and sensed that her death was imminent. With few literary devices and little flourish, this poem is a straightforward reflection of the narrator’s passion and emotion. The first segment, あらざらむ, or literally “to not exist,” is a powerful and saddening announcement of the narrator’s declining health. This is in conjunction with the narrator’s final outcry – “how I wish to see you one more time!” The narrator’s adamant passion despite her sickness is the highlight of the overall gentle and subdued poem. Another well-known poem written by Izumi Shikibu is the following: 黒髪の乱れも知らずうち臥せばまづかきやりし人ぞ恋しき (<i>Goshūi Wakashū</i> Love 3-755), which means “I do not care that my black hair is disheveled; yet lying down, I yearn for the person who used to stroke it.”

          The headnote to this poem in the <i>Shin Kokin Wakashū</i> reads, "A childhood friend whom I saw for the first time in years, but only momentarily, on the tenth day of the seventh month, you departed as if racing with the moon." Murasaki Shikibu's use of this as the prefatory poem to the <i>Murasaki Shikibu Collection</i> shows the significance of this poem and the friendship to her. The phrases めぐり逢ひて and 雲隠れにし describe both the moon and the friend. As a beloved object (moon) or a person (friend) hastily vanishes after appearing for the first time in a long time, the poet likens her friend to the moon to express her sadness and frustration. <i>Taigen-dome</i>.

          The source of this poem, <i>Gō Shui Wakashū</i>, includes a headnote to this poem that says, "An estranged man expresses his doubtful thoughts." This implies that the man, who has been neglecting the narrator, was blind to his own shortcomings when speaking of his anxiety about the narrator's change of heart in a letter. This poem conveys the poetess' bitter and poignant outcry of love in response to the man's irresponsible words. Taking into account the <i>kake-kotoba,</i> this poem can be understood as: "When the wind blows across Ina's plain of bamboo grass near Mount Arima, the rustling sound (そよ) is like saying 'look, that is the case (そよ),' why would I ever forget you? (I will never forget you)." The narrator's sarcastic yet loving feeling towards the man reverberate through the strong irony of the last phrase.

          It is believed that Akazome did not compose this poem based on her own love experience, but was a ghostwriter for one of her female contemporaries. This is not surprising, as distinguished poems were considered to be shared properties of female writers collectively during the Heian period. The headnote to this poem in the <i>Gō Shui Wakashū</i> says that this poem was composed for someone to whom Fujiwara-no-Michitaka had promised to pay a visit but never fulfilled the commitment. When Fujiwara-no-Michitaka (husband of Gidō Sanshi-no-Haha [#54]) was still a Major General, he seemed to have had an amorous relationship with a friend of Akazome's. Perhaps because Akazome presumably composed this poem from a third-person perspective, it conveys more strongly sympathetic advice towards the lover that she should be sleeping peacefully alone, rather than pining away through the night.

          Koshikibu was a talented <i>waka</i> poetess at a young age. Because of the mature exquisiteness of her poems, there were rumors that her work was composed by her mother. At a poetry contest, Fujiwara-no-Sadayori (#64) taunted Koshikibu by suggesting that she was waiting for a messenger she had sent to her mother's place for help on the poem. In response, Koshikibu composed this impromptu poem including three place names (<i>uta-makura</i>) and two puns (<i>kake-kotoba</i>). Later accounts of this story claim that Sadayori, unable to think of a response, fled in shame. With the backstory in mind, this poem can be interpreted as follows: "Too far beyond Mount Ōe (where my mother lives) is the path to Ikuno; never have I trodden the Bridge to Heaven, nor have I seen (any letter from my mother)."

          The headnote to this poem in the <i>Shika Wakashū</i> says that Ise Taifu was asked to compose this poem recalling when the double cherry blossoms were presented to Emperor Ichijō in (the old capital) Nara. Fujiwara- no-Michinaga's request to Ise Taifu to compose a poem was seen as a trial to the new attending lady-in-waiting. She answered with this graceful poem. いにしへ ("ancient") and けふ ("today"), 八重 ("eightfold") and 九重 ("ninefold, the Court") are parallels characteristic of Chinese poetry. Ise-no-Taifu skillfully praised the blossoming of cherry blossoms that arrived from the ancient imperial palace of Nara to the new capital, while also expressing joyful recognition of the successful reign of Emperor Ichijō. This poem was immediately received with overwhelmingly positive acknowledgement by the court, according to the <i>Fukurozōshi.</i>

          It seems that Fujiwara-no-Yukinari came to the Court and stayed talking with Sei Shōnagon until late, then excused himself. The next morning, he told her that he regretted that ‘the rooster forced him to leave.’ Sei Shōnagon responded, ‘Was it that rooster of the Han-gu Gateway?’ (In the <i></i>Records of the Grand Historian, Lord Meng-chang fooled the gatekeepers of the Han-gu Checkpoint into opening the gateway by mimicking a roosters' crow.) She thus mocks Yukinari for fabricating excuses in order to leave. He answers that he was concerned with the much less distant Osaka Gateway, implying that he had wished to spend the night with Sei Shōnagon, to which Sei Shōnagon replied with this poem. He then answered: ‘I have heard the Osaka Gateway can be freely crossed, even when the rooster does not crow, the gate is opened wide, awaiting people. (I suppose you are also like the Osaka Gateway, taking in anyone who comes?)"        </p>

          “The Emperor, after becoming aware of (my) secret meetings with the Imperial Princess of Ise Shrine, (Princess Masako, daughter of Emperor Sanjō), sent maids to guard (her). Thereafter, even my secret visits were prevented.” In 1016, Emperor Sanjō retired. Nine months later, Princess Masako finished her term as the Ise priestess and returned to the capital. It was then that the 25-year-old Michimasa fell in love with her and saw her in secret. Michimasa then separated from his wife despite having two children. Sanjō was enraged upon learning that Michimasa had been visiting his daughter, and so arranged for the relocation of Princess Masako and increased her guards to prevent Michimasa's visits. This poem was composed during that time of frustration and despair. Although the poet was thoroughly committed to his love, he had no choice but to give up. Even if it were just a word of farewell, he wishes that he could convey it directly to Masako in person, rather than through a messenger. However, Princess Masako entered the priesthood, then died at 23.        </p>

          Sadayori's poem beautifully captures the picturesque scenery of river mist slowly lifting and clearing, gradually revealing the Uji River fishing
nets adored by so many literati and inhabitants of Kyoto. Uji is a place famous during the Heian period for the numerous villas of nobles and aristocrats. As two examples of other depictions of Uji's fishing nets, Michitsuna-no-Haha (#53) in
her journal <i>Kagerō Nikki (The Gossamer Years)</i> writes, 宇治の川に寄るほど、 霧は来し方見えず立ちわたりて、いとおぼつかなし。 ‘As I approach the
Uji River, looming fog obscures approaching figures and I stand helplessly.’ Also, the <i>Sarashina Nikki</i>, a memoir written by the daughter of a lady-in-waiting, has the following: いみじう風の吹く日、宇治の渡りをするに、網代いと 近う漕ぎよりたり。音にのみ聞きわたりこし宇治川の網代の波も今日ぞ 数ふる。 ‘On a windy day, it came time to cross the Uji River, and at last I rowed closer to the fishing nets, as many as I could count, that I had heard about.’        </p>

          This poem was composed at the Imperial Palace Poetry Contest in the 6th Year of Eishō (1051) with a given theme. It is a poem about a broken heart, narrated by comparing sleeves to reputation, two things that seem
unrelated, but are united here by being tainted (朽ち) by tears and love. Comparing and contrasting something tangible and something intangible is a valued technique in Japanese <i>waka</i> poems, as can be seen in various <i>jo-kotoba</i> and <i>kake-kotoba</i>. The description of tangible drenched sleeves makes the image of a tainted reputation more vivid. Although Sagami composed this poem at a contest with a given theme, it is likely that she used her actual feelings from her marriage as an inspiration. Possibly due to discord with her husband at the time, many of her poems describe her grief and her desire for a child.        </p>

          A headnote in the <i>Kin'yō Wakashū</i> states that the author composed this poem on Mount Ōmine (Nara Prefecture) upon unexpectedly seeing a mountain cherry tree. Ōmine is among the mountains where priests and ascetics practice their arduous discipline with little rest or food in order to accumulate spiritual power and have their prayers answered. The sudden
encounter with the exquisite mountain cherry on the author's ascetic path, where he had thought only pine trees grew, must have come as a pleasant surprise – as if the author had come across a close acquaintance in an unfamiliar land. The poet may be projecting his own circumstances onto the mountain cherry tree as someone who quietly flourishes alone deep in the mountains, without companions or appreciation.       </p>

          The headnote in the <i>Senzai Wakashū</i> describes the story behind this poem: On a brightly moonlit night in spring, courtiers and court ladies were socializing until late. A tired Lady Suō, leaning against some support, overhears a lady whispering that she would love to have a pillow, and the Chief Councilor at the time, Fujiwara-no-Tadaie, playfully offers his arm as a pillow by sliding it underneath the bamboo blind separating him from the lady. Lady Suō then
wittily composes this poem in response to his suggestive frolic. "As fleeting as a spring night's dream is having your arm as my pillow, how regrettable is it if my good name is soiled by useless rumors." The usage of "a spring night" not only serves to denote an ephemeral moment, but also suggests amorous intent. With phrases such as "dream" and "arm pillow," Lady Suō vividly portrays an audaciously flirtatious Fujiwara-no-Tadaie. In response, Fujiwara-no-Tadaie composes the following: 契りありて春の夜深き手枕をいかがかひなき夢に なすべき. ‘Because of fate I slide my arm as a pillow, as deep as the spring night, but why compare it to a vain dream when you can compare it to reality.’        </p>

          The <i>Goshūi Wakashū</i> records that Emperor Sanjō "having reached his decision to abdicate the throne due to illness, saw the brightly shining moon." Emperor Sanjō's illness was most likely glaucoma, an eye disorder that gradually destroys one's vision. The <i>Eiga Monogatari (A Tale of Flowering Fortunes)</i> records that Emperor Sanjō was troubled by supernatural revelations and had resorted to ritual prayers. This poem was composed during a period of such deep misery, when Emperor Sanjō saw the moon with his
declining eyesight. As his vision failed, Emperor Sanjō must have felt a profound appreciation for the bright moonlight that he could still view, as well as understandable fear of not being able to enjoy the same sight very much longer. However, the real reason behind Emperor Sanjō's abdication was a power play. Sanjo was pressured on the pretext of his blindness by Fujiwara-no- Michinaga, whose intention was to install his grandson, the son of Emperor Ichijō and Michinaga's daughter Shōshi, on the throne, further consolidating Michinaga's political power. This poem also hints at Sanjo’s weariness of the power struggle.        </p>

This poem was composed at the Imperial Palace Poetry Contest in Year 4 of Eishō (1059), during the fifth year of Emperor Go-Reizei's reign. "Autumn Colors" was chosen as the theme of the poetry contest. This poem is a creation of Monk Nōin's vivid imagination, rather than a depiction of the actual landscape. In a typical poetry contest (uta-awase),
          the contestants, usually aristocrats, are divided into two teams: the Left and the Right. During each round, one poem from each side, composed on a theme provided by the organizer approximately a month in advance, is matched and judged. The judgment of a poem is based not only on the quality of the poem composed, but also on the garments of the poet and various other elements of the performance. Additionally, the contestant was not necessarily the composer of a poem, as powerful politicians often received help from poets of lower social status.

          According to its headnote in the <i>Shika Wakashū ("Collection of Verbal Flowers"),</i> this poem was composed shortly after Ryōzen Hōshi retired to a solitary hermitage at Ōhara. The narrator's "loneliness" could be explained by his relocation from Mount Hiei, where thousands of monks were practicing, to Ōhara ("big fields"). From the loneliness of his solitary hermitage, Ryōzen comes out of his hut and observes the same loneliness in the desolate, darkening autumn evening. This ‘lament’ is actually a privilege for recluses like Ryōzen
Hōshi who find sublime beauty in solitude. Like Egyō Hōshi who yearned for a dilapidated residence in poem #47, or Kisen Hōshi who was perfectly content living in solitude on Mount Uji in #8, Ryōzen Hōshi was leading a life that many long to have, away from the hustle and bustle. Ryōzen's life as a recluse was lonely, but also liberating. A similar poem by Jakuren Hōshi is the following: 寂しさはその色としもなかりけり真木立て山の秋の夕暮れ (Shin Kokin Wakashū Autumn I 361), ‘Loneliness is not a single color – mountains lined with yew pine in the autumn dusk.’

          The headnote to this poem in the <i>Kin'yō Wakashū</i> records, ‘Morokata Ason (a Heian aristocrat, poet, and expert at several musical instruments) invited people to Umetsu (Kyoto) to come together and compose
          poems on the theme of autumn breeze at a rural cottage,’ which was the occasion for this poem. Aristocrats living in the cities with perpetual dust and noise yearned for the quiet solitude of the countryside and often spent their free time in their rural villas to experience living like hermits. Many poems like this were composed not only to describe the surrounding scenic nature, but also to praise the owner of a magnificent rural villa. This poem portrays one of these beautiful and natural countryside images vividly synaesthetically, including the touch of autumnal breeze, the sound of rice leaves, the sight of the reed-thatched hut, and a sense of the passage of time as the evening arrives. A precious moment is wonderfully captured in just five refreshing lines.        </p>

          According to a headnote in the <i>Kin'yō Wakashū</i>, this poem was composed in 1102 at a poetry contest between men and women, using the same
          mood and imagery. Lady Kii composed this poem in reply to the following poem by Fujiwara-no-Toshitada, father of Toshinari (#83): 人知れぬ思ひあり その浦風に波のよるこそ言はまほしけれ ‘Unknown by others, I am thinking of you; like the waves thrown by the wind against the rocky shore of Ariso, I long to speak with you this night.’ ありそ and よる are both <i>kake-kotobas</i>. In response, Lady Kii uses the same structure to say, ‘Unpredictable waves as famous as those at the highly reputed Takashi's beach will only wet my sleeves
          if I let myself think of you (your words would only wet my sleeves with tears).’ She successfully fends off the playboy.        </p>

          According to a headnote in the <i>Go Shūi Wakashū</i>, this poem was
          composed at a banquet on the theme of "gazing afar at mountain cherries." The poet hopes that the mist might not spread and hide the sight of the blossoming cherry trees on the mountains nearby. The ‘cherry blossoms’ may have served as a metaphor for the prosperity and high position of Fujiwara-no-Moromichi, the host of the banquet. Therefore, the narrator's desire that fog not spread implies the poet's wishes for Moromichi's success and well-being never to fade. Moreover, the combination of two visual perspectives, a close "nearby mountain" and faraway "high mountains," as well as the personification of the mist, to whom the narrator asks to "not rise," are highlights of this poem.        </p>

Hence his resigned adjuration – ‘Go ahead – be fierce as these winds as well!’ This poem can be read simply as a winter scene, and some books have it classified under ‘winter.’ However, the style of this poem belongs to a more progressive genre – it floats on a description of nature that is completely in line with the feelings of the poet.        </p>

          The headnote mentions that this poem was composed after Mototoshi had complained about his son not receiving a requested official
          function, and had gotten the following poem (<i>Shin Kokinshu</i> 1916) as an answer from Tadamichi (#76): なをたのめしめぢがはらのさせも草わがよの中に あらんかぎりは. “You can still rely on me! For I will help those of this world as long as there are <i>sasemo</i> plants in the fields of Shimeji.” Mototoshi replied to this with his own poem, referring to the <i>sasemo</i> plants again. One of its varieties is the <i>asagiriso</i>, which means ‘morning mist,’ <i>artemisia schmidtiana</i>. <i>Sasemo</i> is a pivot word with its underlying reading as <i>sashimogusa</i>, which can also be read as <i>sa shimo gusa</i>, ‘so much I counted on you.’ The image of dew is also often used as a metaphor for tears. The use of おく is especially skillful.        </p>

          This poem was written duringThe interpretation of this poem rests mostly on the perception of waves and clouds. The experience of looking towards distant mountains and being confused about whether one sees clouds or snowy peaks is something many will recognize. In this case, the waves could stand for the turbulence of the times, and the clouds for heaven, meaning the government or imperial court. As Regent, Tadamichi was practically the most powerful person in Japan. This poem was written in 1135, and he had become regent in 1123. Did he foresee trouble ahead for the imperial court? Did he have secret ambitions (reading <i>hisakata</i> as <i>hisashi kata</i>, ‘lasting too long’)? Was the high task of Regent more turbulent than the imperturbability of the imperial court? the Emperor’s exile on Oki, and refers to his defeat by the Kamakura Shogunate, which kept future Emperors powerless. The Emperor died on the Oki Islands and this was the end of true Imperial power. The later half of this poem means, "I am troubled by various thoughts, for I am burdened with this world," a concern unique to an emperor.

          Could the poet be referring to his wish that he be reinstalled as Emperor, making Tadamichi (#76) the personification of the rock that is preventing this? Or was it a simple observation of nature? Or does it refer to the Buddhist belief in the unity of all things? Or was it just a love poem after all? Ironically, the Yasui Konpira shrine is now located at the site of the Komyoin Kanshoji where Minamoto Yorimasa and Emperor Sutoku, arch-enemies, have both been deified and ‘peacefully reunited.’ Here you can find a rock that is considered to unite lovers. It is possible that this poem is related to the rock. Sutoku’s mausoleum is just a bit north-west of this shrine, in the 大中院.        </p>

During the Nara Period, clouds were considered an annoyance as they often block the sight of the moon, but here the poet provides a simple yet beautifully nuanced description of a glimpse of the autumn moon through the clouds against the dark blue night sky, rendered more exquisite by the enticingly intermittent views of the moonlight.        </p>

            This is a wonderful simile relating tangled feelings to hair. It is thought to be a woman’s response to a man’s morning-after letter. Heian women usually wore their hair long and straight down their backs either loose or bound into a low ponytail. Only servants sometimes put it up and even that was not the rule. Note, also, the vowel harmonies:
            <br>Line 1 – a-a-a-a,
            <br>Line 2 – o-o-o-o,
            <br>Lines 3-4 – mi-mi,

          The <i>hototogisu</i> is an early summer bird, much smaller than the European cuckoo, whose song can be heard day and night in mountainous plateaus, hills and fields. This bird is a famous topic in poetry. Furthermore, it was considered a grace to be able to hear the first cry (初音) of a <i>hototogisu</i> in early summer. This poem conveys a sense that after staying up through the night and waiting to hear the <i>hototogisu</i>'s first cry, the narrator turns towards the cry as soon as he hears it, yet the <i>hototogisu</i> is already gone and only the waning moon remains. The cry of a <i>hototogisu</i> is sometimes associated with the longing of the spirits of the dead to return to their loved ones. Here the cuckoo draws the poet’s attention to the moon.        </p>

          The poet became a monk in his 80s. Although it is not entirely clear when in his life Monk Dōin composed this poem, its sentiment is more consistent with that of someone recently disappointed in love than with the mindset proper to a monk. Nonetheless, it is a brilliant expression of hopeless grief.        </p>

          The interpretation of this poem is dependant on the key term <i>omohi-iru</i>, which allows for expression of melancholy, mortality, or even political disorder of the day between the Minamoto and Taira clans, heralding the end of the Heian period. Assonance between <i>naka, nakere, and nakunaru</i> further enhances the ambiguity.
          Even in the mountains one cannot escape heartbreak. #5 also refers to the cry of a deer. The style here is that of <i>yūgen</i>, emphasizing mystery, nostalgia, and regret; Toshinari’s writing is sometimes described as ‘old diction with new treatment.’ He wrote that poems ‘should somehow produce an effect of charm, mystery, and depth.’ Here one appreciates the poetic principle that sublimity resides not in what is said, but in what is not said.

          しのぶ has two meanings: the first meaning, ‘to bear, endure,’ refers to the arduous "present day" of the second line, and the second meaning, ‘to think of fondly, be nostalgic about,’ refers both to the "times once seen as sad" in the fourth line and the "present day," which the narrator believes that he will think back fondly of once enough time has passed. The seamless union of the past, present, and future is a unique aspect of this poem, which could be a comment on the changing nature of human feelings. The poem could also be interpreted as a friendly exhortation in a difficult situation or as a comment on the state of the world.        </p>

          Its headnote (月前恋といへる心をよめる) indicates that this poem is composed on the theme of love inspired by the moon. The first half of this poem employs personification, "This sadness, is it the moon who makes me indulge in my thoughts?" This is followed by the adversative particle やは, indicating that, "No, it is not. Yet tears stream down my troubled face as if it's the moon's fault." This poem also can be seen as related to #23, in which case the sight of the autumn moon incites a sense of desolation and the narrator's lament.        </p>

          This is a poem composed in the second month of 1201 (Kennin 1) at a poetry contest hosted by Emperor Go-Toba. Monk Jakuren defeated his competitor Echizen with this poem. The problem with the expression ‘rising mist’ is that we can either see ‘rising’ as ‘dissipating’ or as ‘deepening.’ Either way, this is a sublime description of an autumn evening. Jakuren's usage of evergreens such as the yew pine leaves in autumn differs form the usual association of the maple leaves ablaze with redness. This unique depiction of autumn offers a sense of fresh serenity consistent with the remainder of this poem.        </p>

          This poem has references to #19 (Naniwa reeds) and #20 (みを つくし). It was written for a poetry contest on the theme of ‘love at a traveler’s
          inn.’ It has many pivot words, but the gist is that the protagonist does not feel one night in an inn should impose a life-long commitment: "Like one section of Naniwa Bay's reed stubble, (we had only) spent one night at the inn, must I exhaust myself like a channel marker for the love (of him)?"        </p>

          According to the headnote, this poem was composed on the theme of love for a poetry contest and alludes to (<i>honka-dori</i>) a poem by Shigeyuki (#48): 松島や小島の磯にあさりせしあまの袖社かくはぬれしか (‘Matsushima! On Ojima’s isle collecting clams the divers’ sleeves must be soaked like mine.’) It was believed at the time that tears of sadness would stain one's sleeves red like blood. Therefore, the poetess Attendant to Empress Inpu would like to show Shigeyuki her sleeves that are wet and discolored from tears, in comparison to those of the divers that remain unchanged even after wetting through repeatedly. Fishermen, or in this case clamdiggers, were traditionally women, so it is only natural to understand this poem as the poet’s comparison of her sleeves to those of other women.        </p>

          This poem may reflect Yoshitsune's state of desolation at the time, as his wife had passed away shortly before he composed this poem. Alternatively, some commentators think this poem refers to #3 (‘must I sleep alone’), while others assume it alludes to (<i>honka-dori</i>) an anonymous poem from the <i>Kokinshu</i> (‘on a cold straw mat’): さむしろに衣かたしきこよひも や我をまつらむうぢのはしひめ ‘On a cold reed-mat with a single robe as pillow; this evening too, is she waiting for me - the Princess of Uji Bridge?’        </p>

          According to the <i>Senzai Wakashu</i>, the theme of this poem is ‘love like a rock.’ Lady Sanuki sees her steadfast hidden love as a rock unseen at high tide and compares her own sleeves drenched with tears to the unseen rock that is never dry, even though other people may never know. The whole image sounds rather ominous, as though someone might hit the rock and sink.        </p>

Nonetheless, at 27 he was assassinated by his nephew, the Priest Kugyo, on the steps of the Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine in Kamakura, and with him died the influence of the Minamoto clan.        </p>

          もがも expresses a wish contrary-to-fact (‘if only’) and sadness in かなし, ‘charming’ but also ‘sad’). つねに ‘always’ also resonates with つな
          で ‘mooring ropes.’ Note the passivity of the imagery used to express his aching need for comforting security. It is especially moving when one considers that the boy just wanted to write poetry, but was cast onto the political stage and sacrificed by his mother’s clan. It persuasively expresses the Buddhist idea of inconstancy (無常).        </p>

          The poet uses imaginative suggestion and refutation to see in himself a reflection of the chaos around him. That Kintsune, for all his power and influence, would himself wither and die is linked by the <i>kake-kotoba</i> ふる to the falling snow, enhanced by the imagery of cherry blossoms falling like snowflakes in the wild wind. An adjusted word order renders the image clearer: It is not snow in the garden where cherry blossoms have been ”invited” to fall by the wild wind – it is I myself that am withering away.        </p>

          In 1198 the Shogun forced Go-Toba to abdicate, and the power of succeeding Emperors was very limited. In 1221, the Shogun deposed his son Juntoku (#100) and installed Go-Toba’s three-year-old grandson, Chukyo, as Emperor. Go-Toba then staged a rebellion, known as the Jokyu War, in an attempt to reclaim the throne and overthrow the Kamakura Shogunate. Go-Toba’s rebellion was defeated and he was exiled to the Oki Islands. He was a swordsmith, calligrapher, painter, musician, poet, critic, editor and patron of poetry anthologies. He commissioned the Shin Kokinshu, which he also edited and revised during his exile. He is now an enshrined deity at the Minase Shrine.

          This poem was written during the Emperor’s exile on Oki, and refers to his defeat by the Kamakura Shogunate, which kept future Emperors powerless. The Emperor died on the Oki Islands and this was the end of true Imperial power. The later half of this poem means, "I am troubled by various thoughts, for I am burdened with this world," a concern unique to an emperor.

elegance and refinement, one can sense a clear shift in focus from the first poems to
the last ones. Characteristic of a vibrant new pastoral ethos, the first poems are of a
hopeful nature, while the last reflect disillusionment and decay, yet throughout, the
collection is imbued with the Buddhist ethos of 無常 - transience.
