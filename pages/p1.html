          was the 38<sup>th</sup> Emperor of Japan. After overthrowing the Soga clan, he implemented the Taika reforms, moved the capital to Omi (Shiga Prefecture), and reigned as one who sincerely cared about his people, sympathizing, as here, with the peasants.

          This poem alludes to an occasion on which the Emperor was helping farmers by scaring away birds as they harvested the crop. In a sudden rain shower, he sought shelter in a make-shift hut, thatched only with coarse rushes which afforded little protection. The slow, quiet dripping of the dew from the roof contrasts with the sweat of the farmers harvesting the rice. Mindful of their difficult labor, the Emperor sympathizes with the peasants.

          daughter of Emperor Tenji and 41<sup>st</sup> Emperor of Japan, ruled after her husband, the Emperor Tenmu, had died. At that time, smooth transition in the seasons was attributed to the wise rule of the Emperor. So, the depiction of summer arriving after spring has passed conveys a sense of hopefulness and satisfaction with the reign.

          The poet employs many poetic literary devices to skillfully convey his love in this poem. The <i>kake-kotobas</i> in the poem could be interpreted as follows: “How should I describe to you (いぶき) that I love you so, and how unaware you are. Like Mount Ibuki (いぶき)’s moxa grass, my thoughts are burning.” The headnote of this poem in its source, <i>Goshūi Wakashū</i>, says, “Composed right after (the poet) started seeing her,” so it is likely that the poet sent this poem as a part of the first letter to the woman he was passionately in love with. Even though they are rarely heard of today, Japanese mugworts were commonly used by people, including ladies, of the Heian period during moxibustion treatments.

          The poet employs many poetic literary devices to skillfully convey his love in this poem. The <i>kake-kotobas</i> in the poem could be interpreted as follows: “How should I describe to you (いぶき) that I love you so, and how unaware you are. Like Mount Ibuki (いぶき)’s moxa grass, my thoughts are burning.” The headnote of this poem in its source, <i>Goshūi Wakashū</i>, says, “Composed right after (the poet) started seeing her,” so it is likely that the poet sent this poem as a part of the first letter to the woman he was passionately in love with. Even though they are rarely heard of today, Japanese mugworts were commonly used by people, including ladies, of the Heian period during moxibustion treatments.

          The poet employs many poetic literary devices to skillfully convey his love in this poem. The <i>kake-kotobas</i> in the poem could be interpreted as follows: “How should I describe to you (いぶき) that I love you so, and how unaware you are. Like Mount Ibuki (いぶき)’s moxa grass, my thoughts are burning.” The headnote of this poem in its source, <i>Goshūi Wakashū</i>, says, “Composed right after (the poet) started seeing her,” so it is likely that the poet sent this poem as a part of the first letter to the woman he was passionately in love with. Even though they are rarely heard of today, Japanese mugworts were commonly used by people, including ladies, of the Heian period during moxibustion treatments.

          The headnote to this poem in the <i>Goshūi Wakashū</i> reads “sent to a woman after returning from her chambers on a snowy day.” Therefore, this poem is interpreted as a “morning-after” poem, composed by a man as he returns home from an overnight stay at a woman’s residence. At first glance, this poem might appear to be describing a saddening experience, but a closer examination reveals the narrator’s strong wish to stay with the lady and his reproachful feeling towards the start of a day, even though he understands that a night never occurs without daybreak. Reason, which the narrator understands, conflicts with his honest emotion towards separating from his lover during the day. Such contradiction was praised as a refined style of poems, as it portrays the ideal image of a man in love, who unconditionally sacrifices himself in the name of love, even though he knows that certain things he wishes for are unreasonable.

          In <i>Kagerō Nikki</i>, Udaishō writes that in August 955, she gave a difficult delivery to her son, but soon discovered that her husband Kanaie was having extramarital affairs. When he eventually visited her, she made him wait outside the gate. The next morning she gave him this poem, along with a chrysanthemum that had changed color (as a symbol of his changed heart). In return, Kanaie composed the following poem: げにやげに冬の夜ならぬ真木 の戸も遅くあくるはわびしかりけり ‘As you said, the winter night is not only long, but when the yew plum pine gate opens late, it is also harsh.’ Udaishō contemplated taking Buddhist vows, but ultimately devoted herself to her children instead.

          In the system of ‘duolocal marriage (通い婚),’ if a husband lost passion towards his wife, he could simply stop visiting her, and eventually terminate the marriage. There was nothing women at that time could do but wait. When the newlywed Takashina-no-Kishi composed this poem, Michitaka must have sworn never to change his feelings towards her. Even though Kishi might have been happy during the early days of marriage to Michitaka, she may also have felt uncertain regarding the future, compelling her to wish that she could
          die on the day when Michitaka swore the oath. In actuality, Michitaka was known to be a caring husband to Kishi, and Kishi was praised as a wise mother and educated woman. Unfortunately, Michitaka passed away suddenly, Kishi’s sons fell from power, and her daughter became a priestess, all of which gives a sad twist to this poem.

Although the waterfall had dried up long before and the sounds could no longer be heard, its fame still endured. は forms a contrast with こそ, while the repetition of た and な create a formidable resonance.

          It is believed that this poem was sent to an unknown lover by Lady Izumi Shikibu when she was very ill and sensed that her death was imminent. With few literary devices and little flourish, this poem is a straightforward reflection of the narrator’s passion and emotion. The first segment, あらざらむ, or literally “to not exist,” is a powerful and saddening announcement of the narrator’s declining health. This is in conjunction with the narrator’s final outcry – “how I wish to see you one more time!” The narrator’s adamant passion despite her sickness is the highlight of the overall gentle and subdued poem. Another well-known poem written by Izumi Shikibu is the following: 黒髪の乱れも知らずうち臥せばまづかきやりし人ぞ恋しき (<i>Goshūi Wakashū</i> Love 3-755), which means “I do not care that my black hair is disheveled; yet lying down, I yearn for the person who used to stroke it.”

          The headnote to this poem in the <i>Shin Kokin Wakashū</i> reads, "A childhood friend whom I saw for the first time in years, but only momentarily, on the tenth day of the seventh month, you departed as if racing with the moon." Murasaki Shikibu's use of this as the prefatory poem to the <i>Murasaki Shikibu Collection</i> shows the significance of this poem and the friendship to her. The phrases めぐり逢ひて and 雲隠れにし describe both the moon and the friend. As a beloved object (moon) or a person (friend) hastily vanishes after appearing for the first time in a long time, the poet likens her friend to the moon to express her sadness and frustration. <i>Taigen-dome</i>.

          The source of this poem, <i>Gō Shui Wakashū</i>, includes a headnote to this poem that says, "An estranged man expresses his doubtful thoughts." This implies that the man, who has been neglecting the narrator, was blind to his own shortcomings when speaking of his anxiety about the narrator's change of heart in a letter. This poem conveys the poetess' bitter and poignant outcry of love in response to the man's irresponsible words. Taking into account the <i>kake-kotoba,</i> this poem can be understood as: "When the wind blows across Ina's plain of bamboo grass near Mount Arima, the rustling sound (そよ) is like saying 'look, that is the case (そよ),' why would I ever forget you? (I will never forget you)." The narrator's sarcastic yet loving feeling towards the man reverberate through the strong irony of the last phrase.

          It is believed that Akazome did not compose this poem based on her own love experience, but was a ghostwriter for one of her female contemporaries. This is not surprising, as distinguished poems were considered to be shared properties of female writers collectively during the Heian period. The headnote to this poem in the <i>Gō Shui Wakashū</i> says that this poem was composed for someone to whom Fujiwara-no-Michitaka had promised to pay a visit but never fulfilled the commitment. When Fujiwara-no-Michitaka (husband of Gidō Sanshi-no-Haha [#54]) was still a Major General, he seemed to have had an amorous relationship with a friend of Akazome's. Perhaps because Akazome presumably composed this poem from a third-person perspective, it conveys more strongly sympathetic advice towards the lover that she should be sleeping peacefully alone, rather than pining away through the night.

          Koshikibu was a talented <i>waka</i> poetess at a young age. Because of the mature exquisiteness of her poems, there were rumors that her work was composed by her mother. At a poetry contest, Fujiwara-no-Sadayori (#64) taunted Koshikibu by suggesting that she was waiting for a messenger she had sent to her mother's place for help on the poem. In response, Koshikibu composed this impromptu poem including three place names (<i>uta-makura</i>) and two puns (<i>kake-kotoba</i>). Later accounts of this story claim that Sadayori, unable to think of a response, fled in shame. With the backstory in mind, this poem can be interpreted as follows: "Too far beyond Mount Ōe (where my mother lives) is the path to Ikuno; never have I trodden the Bridge to Heaven, nor have I seen (any letter from my mother)."

          The headnote to this poem in the <i>Shika Wakashū</i> says that Ise Taifu was asked to compose this poem recalling when the double cherry blossoms were presented to Emperor Ichijō in (the old capital) Nara. Fujiwara- no-Michinaga's request to Ise Taifu to compose a poem was seen as a trial to the new attending lady-in-waiting. She answered with this graceful poem. いにしへ ("ancient") and けふ ("today"), 八重 ("eightfold") and 九重 ("ninefold, the Court") are parallels characteristic of Chinese poetry. Ise-no-Taifu skillfully praised the blossoming of cherry blossoms that arrived from the ancient imperial palace of Nara to the new capital, while also expressing joyful recognition of the successful reign of Emperor Ichijō. This poem was immediately received with overwhelmingly positive acknowledgement by the court, according to the <i>Fukurozōshi.</i>

          It seems that Fujiwara-no-Yukinari came to the Court and stayed talking with Sei Shōnagon until late, then excused himself. The next morning, he told her that he regretted that ‘the rooster forced him to leave.’ Sei Shōnagon responded, ‘Was it that rooster of the Han-gu Gateway?’ (In the <i></i>Records of the Grand Historian, Lord Meng-chang fooled the gatekeepers of the Han-gu Checkpoint into opening the gateway by mimicking a roosters' crow.) She thus mocks Yukinari for fabricating excuses in order to leave. He answers that he was concerned with the much less distant Osaka Gateway, implying that he had wished to spend the night with Sei Shōnagon, to which Sei Shōnagon replied with this poem. He then answered: ‘I have heard the Osaka Gateway can be freely crossed, even when the rooster does not crow, the gate is opened wide, awaiting people. (I suppose you are also like the Osaka Gateway, taking in anyone who comes?)"        </p>

          “The Emperor, after becoming aware of (my) secret meetings with the Imperial Princess of Ise Shrine, (Princess Masako, daughter of Emperor Sanjō), sent maids to guard (her). Thereafter, even my secret visits were prevented.” In 1016, Emperor Sanjō retired. Nine months later, Princess Masako finished her term as the Ise priestess and returned to the capital. It was then that the 25-year-old Michimasa fell in love with her and saw her in secret. Michimasa then separated from his wife despite having two children. Sanjō was enraged upon learning that Michimasa had been visiting his daughter, and so arranged for the relocation of Princess Masako and increased her guards to prevent Michimasa's visits. This poem was composed during that time of frustration and despair. Although the poet was thoroughly committed to his love, he had no choice but to give up. Even if it were just a word of farewell, he wishes that he could convey it directly to Masako in person, rather than through a messenger. However, Princess Masako entered the priesthood, then died at 23.        </p>

          Sadayori's poem beautifully captures the picturesque scenery of river mist slowly lifting and clearing, gradually revealing the Uji River fishing
nets adored by so many literati and inhabitants of Kyoto. Uji is a place famous during the Heian period for the numerous villas of nobles and aristocrats. As two examples of other depictions of Uji's fishing nets, Michitsuna-no-Haha (#53) in
her journal <i>Kagerō Nikki (The Gossamer Years)</i> writes, 宇治の川に寄るほど、 霧は来し方見えず立ちわたりて、いとおぼつかなし。 ‘As I approach the
Uji River, looming fog obscures approaching figures and I stand helplessly.’ Also, the <i>Sarashina Nikki</i>, a memoir written by the daughter of a lady-in-waiting, has the following: いみじう風の吹く日、宇治の渡りをするに、網代いと 近う漕ぎよりたり。音にのみ聞きわたりこし宇治川の網代の波も今日ぞ 数ふる。 ‘On a windy day, it came time to cross the Uji River, and at last I rowed closer to the fishing nets, as many as I could count, that I had heard about.’        </p>

          This poem was composed at the Imperial Palace Poetry Contest in the 6th Year of Eishō (1051) with a given theme. It is a poem about a broken heart, narrated by comparing sleeves to reputation, two things that seem
unrelated, but are united here by being tainted (朽ち) by tears and love. Comparing and contrasting something tangible and something intangible is a valued technique in Japanese <i>waka</i> poems, as can be seen in various <i>jo-kotoba</i> and <i>kake-kotoba</i>. The description of tangible drenched sleeves makes the image of a tainted reputation more vivid. Although Sagami composed this poem at a contest with a given theme, it is likely that she used her actual feelings from her marriage as an inspiration. Possibly due to discord with her husband at the time, many of her poems describe her grief and her desire for a child.        </p>

          A headnote in the <i>Kin'yō Wakashū</i> states that the author composed this poem on Mount Ōmine (Nara Prefecture) upon unexpectedly seeing a mountain cherry tree. Ōmine is among the mountains where priests and ascetics practice their arduous discipline with little rest or food in order to accumulate spiritual power and have their prayers answered. The sudden
encounter with the exquisite mountain cherry on the author's ascetic path, where he had thought only pine trees grew, must have come as a pleasant surprise – as if the author had come across a close acquaintance in an unfamiliar land. The poet may be projecting his own circumstances onto the mountain cherry tree as someone who quietly flourishes alone deep in the mountains, without companions or appreciation.       </p>

          The headnote in the <i>Senzai Wakashū</i> describes the story behind this poem: On a brightly moonlit night in spring, courtiers and court ladies were socializing until late. A tired Lady Suō, leaning against some support, overhears a lady whispering that she would love to have a pillow, and the Chief Councilor at the time, Fujiwara-no-Tadaie, playfully offers his arm as a pillow by sliding it underneath the bamboo blind separating him from the lady. Lady Suō then
wittily composes this poem in response to his suggestive frolic. "As fleeting as a spring night's dream is having your arm as my pillow, how regrettable is it if my good name is soiled by useless rumors." The usage of "a spring night" not only serves to denote an ephemeral moment, but also suggests amorous intent. With phrases such as "dream" and "arm pillow," Lady Suō vividly portrays an audaciously flirtatious Fujiwara-no-Tadaie. In response, Fujiwara-no-Tadaie composes the following: 契りありて春の夜深き手枕をいかがかひなき夢に なすべき. ‘Because of fate I slide my arm as a pillow, as deep as the spring night, but why compare it to a vain dream when you can compare it to reality.’        </p>

          The <i>Goshūi Wakashū</i> records that Emperor Sanjō "having reached his decision to abdicate the throne due to illness, saw the brightly shining moon." Emperor Sanjō's illness was most likely glaucoma, an eye disorder that gradually destroys one's vision. The <i>Eiga Monogatari (A Tale of Flowering Fortunes)</i> records that Emperor Sanjō was troubled by supernatural revelations and had resorted to ritual prayers. This poem was composed during a period of such deep misery, when Emperor Sanjō saw the moon with his
declining eyesight. As his vision failed, Emperor Sanjō must have felt a profound appreciation for the bright moonlight that he could still view, as well as understandable fear of not being able to enjoy the same sight very much longer. However, the real reason behind Emperor Sanjō's abdication was a power play. Sanjo was pressured on the pretext of his blindness by Fujiwara-no- Michinaga, whose intention was to install his grandson, the son of Emperor Ichijō and Michinaga's daughter Shōshi, on the throne, further consolidating Michinaga's political power. This poem also hints at Sanjo’s weariness of the power struggle.        </p>

          The scattering autumn leaves on Mount Mimuro are likened to a colorful brocade, contrasting the movement of the leaves to the stillness of the river, creating a gorgeous autumn landscape. This poem was composed at the Imperial Palace Poetry Contest in Year 4 of Eishō (1059), during the fifth year of Emperor Go-Reizei's reign. "Autumn Colors" was chosen as the theme of the poetry contest. This poem is a creation of Monk Nōin's vivid imagination, rather than a depiction of the actual landscape. In a typical poetry contest (uta-awase),
          the contestants, usually aristocrats, are divided into two teams: the Left and the Right. During each round, one poem from each side, composed on a theme provided by the organizer approximately a month in advance, is matched and judged. The judgment of a poem is based not only on the quality of the poem composed, but also on the garments of the poet and various other elements of the performance. Additionally, the contestant was not necessarily the composer of a poem, as powerful politicians often received help from poets of lower social status.

          According to its headnote in the <i>Shika Wakashū ("Collection of Verbal Flowers"),</i> this poem was composed shortly after Ryōzen Hōshi retired to a solitary hermitage at Ōhara. The narrator's "loneliness" could be explained by his relocation from Mount Hiei, where thousands of monks were practicing, to Ōhara ("big fields"). From the loneliness of his solitary hermitage, Ryōzen comes out of his hut and observes the same loneliness in the desolate, darkening autumn evening. This ‘lament’ is actually a privilege for recluses like Ryōzen
Hōshi who find sublime beauty in solitude. Like Egyō Hōshi who yearned for a dilapidated residence in poem #47, or Kisen Hōshi who was perfectly content living in solitude on Mount Uji in #8, Ryōzen Hōshi was leading a life that many long to have, away from the hustle and bustle. Ryōzen's life as a recluse was lonely, but also liberating. A similar poem by Jakuren Hōshi is the following: 寂しさはその色としもなかりけり真木立て山の秋の夕暮れ (Shin Kokin Wakashū Autumn I 361), ‘Loneliness is not a single color – mountains lined with yew pine in the autumn dusk.’

          The headnote to this poem in the <i>Kin'yō Wakashū</i> records, ‘Morokata Ason (a Heian aristocrat, poet, and expert at several musical instruments) invited people to Umetsu (Kyoto) to come together and compose
          poems on the theme of autumn breeze at a rural cottage,’ which was the occasion for this poem. Aristocrats living in the cities with perpetual dust and noise yearned for the quiet solitude of the countryside and often spent their free time in their rural villas to experience living like hermits. Many poems like this were composed not only to describe the surrounding scenic nature, but also to praise the owner of a magnificent rural villa. This poem portrays one of these beautiful and natural countryside images vividly synaesthetically, including the touch of autumnal breeze, the sound of rice leaves, the sight of the reed-thatched hut, and a sense of the passage of time as the evening arrives. A precious moment is wonderfully captured in just five refreshing lines.        </p>

          According to a headnote in the <i>Kin'yō Wakashū</i>, this poem was composed in 1102 at a poetry contest between men and women, using the same
          mood and imagery. Lady Kii composed this poem in reply to the following poem by Fujiwara-no-Toshitada, father of Toshinari (#83): 人知れぬ思ひあり その浦風に波のよるこそ言はまほしけれ ‘Unknown by others, I am thinking of you; like the waves thrown by the wind against the rocky shore of Ariso, I long to speak with you this night.’ ありそ and よる are both <i>kake-kotobas</i>. In response, Lady Kii uses the same structure to say, ‘Unpredictable waves as famous as those at the highly reputed Takashi's beach will only wet my sleeves
          if I let myself think of you (your words would only wet my sleeves with tears).’ She successfully fends off the playboy.        </p>

          According to a headnote in the <i>Go Shūi Wakashū</i>, this poem was
          composed at a banquet on the theme of "gazing afar at mountain cherries." The poet hopes that the mist might not spread and hide the sight of the blossoming cherry trees on the mountains nearby. The ‘cherry blossoms’ may have served as a metaphor for the prosperity and high position of Fujiwara-no-Moromichi, the host of the banquet. Therefore, the narrator's desire that fog not spread implies the poet's wishes for Moromichi's success and well-being never to fade. Moreover, the combination of two visual perspectives, a close "nearby mountain" and faraway "high mountains," as well as the personification of the mist, to whom the narrator asks to "not rise," are highlights of this poem.        </p>

          The narrator had prayed at the Kan-non shrine on Mount Hatsuse for a lover. He can hardly have expected someone as unfeeling as this! Hence his resigned adjuration – ‘Go ahead – be fierce as these winds as well!’ This poem can be read simply as a winter scene, and some books have it classified under ‘winter.’ However, the style of this poem belongs to a more progressive genre – it floats on a description of nature that is completely in line with the feelings of the poet.        </p>

          The headnote mentions that this poem was composed after Mototoshi had complained about his son not receiving a requested official
          function, and had gotten the following poem (<i>Shin Kokinshu</i> 1916) as an answer from Tadamichi (#76): なをたのめしめぢがはらのさせも草わがよの中に あらんかぎりは. “You can still rely on me! For I will help those of this world as long as there are <i>sasemo</i> plants in the fields of Shimeji.” Mototoshi replied to this with his own poem, referring to the <i>sasemo</i> plants again. One of its varieties is the <i>asagiriso</i>, which means ‘morning mist,’ <i>artemisia schmidtiana</i>. <i>Sasemo</i> is a pivot word with its underlying reading as <i>sashimogusa</i>, which can also be read as <i>sa shimo gusa</i>, ‘so much I counted on you.’ The image of dew is also often used as a metaphor for tears. The use of おく is especially skillful.        </p>

Tadamichi was on the winning side in a power struggle known as the Hogen Incident (1156), the birth of the Kamakura Period, after which the Emperor was largely ceremonial, while civil and military matters were controlled by the samurai class, led by the shogun. See #75 for the exchange of poems between him and Mototoshi. He finally retired to the Hosshoji Temple, where he was head priest.        </p>

          This poem was written duringThe interpretation of this poem rests mostly on the perception of waves and clouds. The experience of looking towards distant mountains and being confused about whether one sees clouds or snowy peaks is something many will recognize. In this case, the waves could stand for the turbulence of the times, and the clouds for heaven, meaning the government or imperial court. As Regent, Tadamichi was practically the most powerful person in Japan. This poem was written in 1135, and he had become regent in 1123. Did he foresee trouble ahead for the imperial court? Did he have secret ambitions (reading <i>hisakata</i> as <i>hisashi kata</i>, ‘lasting too long’)? Was the high task of Regent more turbulent than the imperturbability of the imperial court? the Emperor’s exile on Oki, and refers to his defeat by the Kamakura Shogunate, which kept future Emperors powerless. The Emperor died on the Oki Islands and this was the end of true Imperial power. The later half of this poem means, "I am troubled by various thoughts, for I am burdened with this world," a concern unique to an emperor.

To pacify his ghost, the Komyoin Kanshoji was erected in 1177 in Kyoto where his residence had once been and he was deified in the Konpira shrine built much later by the Meiji Emperor in accordance with the wish of Emperor Komei.        </p>

          Could the poet be referring to his wish that he be reinstalled as Emperor, making Tadamichi (#76) the personification of the rock that is preventing this? Or was it a simple observation of nature? Or does it refer to the Buddhist belief in the unity of all things? Or was it just a love poem after all? Ironically, the Yasui Konpira shrine is now located at the site of the Komyoin Kanshoji where Minamoto Yorimasa and Emperor Sutoku, arch-enemies, have both been deified and ‘peacefully reunited.’ Here you can find a rock that is considered to unite lovers. It is possible that this poem is related to the rock. Sutoku’s mausoleum is just a bit north-west of this shrine, in the 大中院.        </p>

During the Nara Period, clouds were considered an annoyance as they often block the sight of the moon, but here the poet provides a simple yet beautifully nuanced description of a glimpse of the autumn moon through the clouds against the dark blue night sky, rendered more exquisite by the enticingly intermittent views of the moonlight.        </p>

            This is a wonderful simile relating tangled feelings to hair. It is thought to be a woman’s response to a man’s morning-after letter. Heian women usually wore their hair long and straight down their backs either loose or bound into a low ponytail. Only servants sometimes put it up and even that was not the rule. Note, also, the vowel harmonies:
            <br>Line 1 – a-a-a-a,
            <br>Line 2 – o-o-o-o,

          The <i>hototogisu</i> is an early summer bird, much smaller than the European cuckoo, whose song can be heard day and night in mountainous plateaus, hills and fields. This bird is a famous topic in poetry. Furthermore, it was considered a grace to be able to hear the first cry (初音) of a <i>hototogisu</i> in early summer. This poem conveys a sense that after staying up through the night and waiting to hear the <i>hototogisu</i>'s first cry, the narrator turns towards the cry as soon as he hears it, yet the <i>hototogisu</i> is already gone and only the waning moon remains. The cry of a <i>hototogisu</i> is sometimes associated with the longing of the spirits of the dead to return to their loved ones. Here the cuckoo draws the poet’s attention to the moon.        </p>

          The poet became a monk in his 80s. Although it is not entirely clear when in his life Monk Dōin composed this poem, its sentiment is more consistent with that of someone recently disappointed in love than with the mindset proper to a monk. Nonetheless, it is a brilliant expression of hopeless grief.        </p>

          The interpretation of this poem is dependant on the key term <i>omohi-iru</i>, which allows for expression of melancholy, mortality, or even political disorder of the day between the Minamoto and Taira clans, heralding the end of the Heian period. Assonance between <i>naka, nakere, and nakunaru</i> further enhances the ambiguity.
          Even in the mountains one cannot escape heartbreak. #5 also refers to the cry of a deer. The style here is that of <i>yūgen</i>, emphasizing mystery, nostalgia, and regret; Toshinari’s writing is sometimes described as ‘old diction with new treatment.’ He wrote that poems ‘should somehow produce an effect of charm, mystery, and depth.’ Here one appreciates the poetic principle that sublimity resides not in what is said, but in what is not said.

          しのぶ has two meanings: the first meaning, ‘to bear, endure,’ refers to the arduous "present day" of the second line, and the second meaning, ‘to think of fondly, be nostalgic about,’ refers both to the "times once seen as sad" in the fourth line and the "present day," which the narrator believes that he will think back fondly of once enough time has passed. The seamless union of the past, present, and future is a unique aspect of this poem, which could be a comment on the changing nature of human feelings. The poem could also be interpreted as a friendly exhortation in a difficult situation or as a comment on the state of the world.        </p>

          Its headnote (月前恋といへる心をよめる) indicates that this poem is composed on the theme of love inspired by the moon. The first half of this poem employs personification, "This sadness, is it the moon who makes me indulge in my thoughts?" This is followed by the adversative particle やは, indicating that, "No, it is not. Yet tears stream down my troubled face as if it's the moon's fault." This poem also can be seen as related to #23, in which case the sight of the autumn moon incites a sense of desolation and the narrator's lament.        </p>

          This is a poem composed in the second month of 1201 (Kennin 1) at a poetry contest hosted by Emperor Go-Toba. Monk Jakuren defeated his competitor Echizen with this poem. The problem with the expression ‘rising mist’ is that we can either see ‘rising’ as ‘dissipating’ or as ‘deepening.’ Either way, this is a sublime description of an autumn evening. Jakuren's usage of evergreens such as the yew pine leaves in autumn differs form the usual association of the maple leaves ablaze with redness. This unique depiction of autumn offers a sense of fresh serenity consistent with the remainder of this poem.        </p>

          This poem has references to #19 (Naniwa reeds) and #20 (みを つくし). It was written for a poetry contest on the theme of ‘love at a traveler’s
          inn.’ It has many pivot words, but the gist is that the protagonist does not feel one night in an inn should impose a life-long commitment: "Like one section of Naniwa Bay's reed stubble, (we had only) spent one night at the inn, must I exhaust myself like a channel marker for the love (of him)?"        </p>

          According to the headnote, this poem was composed on the theme of love for a poetry contest and alludes to (<i>honka-dori</i>) a poem by Shigeyuki (#48): 松島や小島の磯にあさりせしあまの袖社かくはぬれしか (‘Matsushima! On Ojima’s isle collecting clams the divers’ sleeves must be soaked like mine.’) It was believed at the time that tears of sadness would stain one's sleeves red like blood. Therefore, the poetess Attendant to Empress Inpu would like to show Shigeyuki her sleeves that are wet and discolored from tears, in comparison to those of the divers that remain unchanged even after wetting through repeatedly. Fishermen, or in this case clamdiggers, were traditionally women, so it is only natural to understand this poem as the poet’s comparison of her sleeves to those of other women.        </p>

          This poem may reflect Yoshitsune's state of desolation at the time, as his wife had passed away shortly before he composed this poem.

          According to the <i>Senzai Wakashu</i>, the theme of this poem is ‘love like a rock.’ Lady Sanuki sees her steadfast hidden love as a rock unseen at high tide and compares her own sleeves drenched with tears to the unseen rock that is never dry, even though other people may never know. The whole image sounds rather ominous, as though someone might hit the rock and sink.        </p>

          was the son of Yoritomo (founder of the Kamakura Shogunate), of which Sanetomo became the third shogun at the age of 12 (under the control of his mother, Hojo Masako). He was the last head of the Minamoto clan of Japan. Rather than participate in the deadly power struggles of his time, he devoted himself to writing poetry, which he studied from Teika. Nonetheless, at 27 he was assassinated by his nephew, the Priest Kugyo, on the steps of the Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine in Kamakura, and with him died the influence of the Minamoto clan.        </p>

          もがも expresses a wish contrary-to-fact (‘if only’) and sadness in かなし, ‘charming’ but also ‘sad’). つねに ‘always’ also resonates with つな
          で ‘mooring ropes.’ Note the passivity of the imagery used to express his aching need for comforting security. It is especially moving when one considers that the boy just wanted to write poetry, but was cast onto the political stage and sacrificed by his mother’s clan. It persuasively expresses the Buddhist idea of inconstancy (無常).        </p>

          The poet uses imaginative suggestion and refutation to see in himself a reflection of the chaos around him. That Kintsune, for all his power and influence, would himself wither and die is linked by the <i>kake-kotoba</i> ふる to the falling snow, enhanced by the imagery of cherry blossoms falling like snowflakes in the wild wind. An adjusted word order renders the image clearer: It is not snow in the garden where cherry blossoms have been ”invited” to fall by the wild wind – it is I myself that am withering away.        </p>

It alludes (<i>honka-dori</i>) to part of a poem in the <i>Manyoshu</i> (686-784), which reads as follows from the perspective of a man: 淡路島松帆の浦に朝なぎに玉藻刈 りつつ夕なぎに藻塩焼きつつ海人娘女ありとは聞けど見に行かむよしの なければ - ‘Awaji Island on Matsuo Bay, in the morning calm they catch jeweled seaweed; in the evening calm they burn seaweed for salt, the fisher- maidens; though I hear they are there, I have no way to go to see them.’        </p>

          In 1198 the Shogun forced Go-Toba to abdicate, and the power of succeeding Emperors was very limited. In 1221, the Shogun deposed his son Juntoku (#100) and installed Go-Toba’s three-year-old grandson, Chukyo, as Emperor. Go-Toba then staged a rebellion, known as the Jokyu War, in an attempt to reclaim the throne and overthrow the Kamakura Shogunate. Go-Toba’s rebellion was defeated and he was exiled to the Oki Islands. He was a swordsmith, calligrapher, painter, musician, poet, critic, editor and patron of poetry anthologies. He commissioned the Shin Kokinshu, which he also edited and revised during his exile. He is now an enshrined deity at the Minase Shrine.

          This poem was written during the Emperor’s exile on Oki, and refers to his defeat by the Kamakura Shogunate, which kept future Emperors powerless. The Emperor died on the Oki Islands and this was the end of true Imperial power. The later half of this poem means, "I am troubled by various thoughts, for I am burdened with this world," a concern unique to an emperor.

          This collection of poems ends, as it began, with a parent-child set of
poems (Tenji #1 – Jito #2 and Gotoba #99 – Juntoku #100). As Juntoku deplores the
decline of Imperial governmentand the end of the Heian period of aristocratic
elegance and refinement, one can sense a clear shift in focus from the first poems to
the last ones. Characteristic of a vibrant new pastoral ethos, the first poems are of a
hopeful nature, while the last reflect disillusionment and decay, yet throughout, the
collection is imbued with the Buddhist ethos of 無常 - transience.
